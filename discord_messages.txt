hey bharath! sorry took me 2 days but got some good results

---

tried that memorization test u suggested - trained on just 5 proteins for 500 epochs
loss went 1.0 -> 0.018 and reconstruction was 0.025A
so yea it can definitely learn when theres limited data

---

also did the code cleanup stuff
added numpy docstrings to all the modules
type hints everywhere
wrote 38 unit tests and theyre all passing now

---

then i ran a full training on the cath data
got 3 k80s working with ddp (had some cudnn issues but fixed them)

ran 1000 epochs overnight, took like 12hrs
loss started 0.97 and got down to 0.033 at epoch 770
final was 0.083 so 96% improvement overall

---

model is 7.5M params, transformer based with per-atom noise prediction
was doing it wrong before (broadcasting single atom noise) but fixed that

---

read the watson paper more carefully too
they have 150k proteins and pretrained weights
i got 30 proteins training from scratch lol
but same mse loss and diffusion process

so 0.033 seems pretty decent? hard to compare since they dont show training curves

---

pushed to github btw
https://github.com/chidwipak/rfdiffusion-prototype

all the scripts, metrics, tests etc

---

what should i focus on next?
thinking either get more data or try adding self conditioning
